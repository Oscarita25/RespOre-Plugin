## This plugin is probably discontinued..

anyways this was a plugin to let ores respawn after a specific period of time, very simple. 
This is now 16 months old (at the point of writing this) so i don't even know if this still works.

If you want to try it out you can download the last (and first xD) release :

### [Respawn Ore v0.1](https://github.com/Oscarita25/RespOre-Plugin/releases/tag/0.1)


### PS:
also increadibly outdated build (deleted the project sorry) ,
it has /heal command in it that was only there for testing purposes.
